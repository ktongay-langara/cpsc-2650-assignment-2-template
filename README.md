# Assignment 2

## Finish Lab 2 as a pre-requisite to this assignment, then continue with the below steps:

1. Add the required code to public/form_validation.js to immediately add the form data to the table at the bottom of the page.
2. Add the required code to public/form_validation.js and public/index.html to display a “Delete” button at the end of each row in the table. When the “Delete” button is clicked, the corresponding row should be deleted from the table and you should invoke the correct Feathers service method to delete the document from the MongoDB collection.
3. Implement CI/CD for the project so that the application will be deployed to Dockerhub.
4. Stage, commit, and push the changes.
